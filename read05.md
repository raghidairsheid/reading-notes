#### comparison operators evaluating conditons:
- the result will be boolean: true or false
> (==)  is equal to: two values to see if they are the same
> (!=) is not eual to: two values to see if they are not the same
> (===) strict equal to: data type and value are the same
> (!==) strict not equal to: data type and value are not the same
> (>) : grather than
> (<) : less than>
> (>=) : grather than and equal
> (<=) : less than and equal

#### using comparison operators:
- evaluate variables

### using expression with comparison operators:

#### comparison two expression

#### logical operators:
- return single values of true or false

  | **and** | **&&** |
  |----|----|
  | **or** | **||** |
  | **not** |**!** |


## LOOPS

![image](https://beginnersbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/for_loop_cpp.jpg)
### 1- for 
> to run code specific number of times

### 2- while 
> if you dont know many times the code should run

### 3- do while
> run statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the conditon evaluates to false


## loop counter 
* as a condition
* run a specified number of times
* condition is made up of three statements: 
> initialization such as: var i =0;
> condition such as: i < 100;
> update, such as: i++ , i--
