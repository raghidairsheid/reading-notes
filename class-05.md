# JPEG vs PNG vs GIF 

**Compression:**

###  **JPEG** is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception.

### **PNG** is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*sD2tU56l8y1jF4BPQdWNYA.png)

### **GIF** is also a lossless image format that uses LZW compression algorithm. It was favoured over PNG for simple graphics in websites in its early days because the support of PNG was still growing.

## Colours

* **JPEG** images can support around 16 million colours.
* **PNG** images mainly have two modes â€” PNG8 and PNG24
* **GIF** images are limited to 256 colours. 



* Animation
