# Mindset
__The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility,A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort,  in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits,I discovered that when I try things, I often get only so far before encountering a challenge and stopping, when it comes to my work, it’s a problem.__
__Here’s an example of my Challenges in learning Java. I studied a bit of Java at university, but I have not completed it.__


### What is differences between a fixed and a growth mindset?
### fixed:
-avoid challenges such as the fear

### growth:
-learn from criticism 

## Criticism in my opinion:
1- My worst days are when I haven’t managed to get things together, it was very trest.
2- I find myself with very few things to look back on positively.

**some questions help me focus on all aspects of my day:**

  1- What aspects of myself am I most proud of?
  
  2- What do I fear?
  
  3- What improve the aspects I’m less proud of?
