## What makes a computer?
What makes a computer?
- we always built a hold to solve a problem like 
  1. well barrow
  2. Hammar
  3. printing press
  4. a tractor-trailer
  #### all these inventions help us with manual work.

- If a machine could be designed to help us with thinking work:
  1. solving equations 
  2. tracking the star in the sky


#### The 4 things common to all computers:

> when a computer connects internet the output from another computer becomes an input to another.

## Binary & Data
* computer work on ones & zeroes
* wires & circuits
  - carry all the information in a computer

#### How do you store or represent information using electricity?
- if single wire the circuits will be (ON or OFF), (YES or NO), (TRUE or FALSE), (1 or 0)
  > its called Binary number system
- The Decimal number system (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
- The Binary number system (0,1)


  ### 1. text in Binary(used ASCII)
  
  | A | 1 | 00001|
  |---|---|------|
  |B  | 2 | 00010|
  | C | 3 | 00011|
  | D | 4 | 00100|
  | E | 5 | 00101|
  | F | 6 | 00110|
  |G  |7  |00111 |

  ### 2. image in Binary (photo, videos, graphics)
  > its tiny dots of in pixels (each pixel has a color, each color can be represented with numbers) 

  ### 3. sound in Binary(series of vibrations)


## circuits & logic
##### every input and output of a computer is effectively tipped information which can be represented by (ON or OFF) or (1 or 0), in order processing of information come from input and it makes the information that output, a computer need to marvel a combined the computer signals.


## Memory, CPU, input & output
- all computer do the same 4 things (each of them done by a different part of the computer)

| **input**| **converts physical input to binary information** |
|--- |---|
| **Memory** | **stors information** |
| **CPU** | **control prossing unit calculates information** |
|**output** | **converts information to physical output** |


## Hardware & Software
- we can see the hardware but we can't see the software
- How do the Hardware and Software work together?
  >using CPU
  
-How can the CPU run them at once?
  > using an operating system
