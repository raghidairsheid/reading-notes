# What is a Function?
#### let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

__some example, the message is held in an HTML element whose id attribute has a value of message.__
*The message is going to be changed using JavaScript.* 
__Before the closing </body> tag, you can see the link to the JavaScript file. then JavaScript file starts with a variable used to hold a new message, and is followed by a function.__

## calling a function
- you can execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.

## Declaring function that need inforimation

## calling a function that need inforimation
- specify the values it shoude in the parentheses that folloe its name.
> the values are called arguments, they can be provided as **values or variables**.

|values | variables |
|--- |--|
|such as: getArea(3,5);| such as: wWidth = 2; wHeight = 2; getArea(wWidth,wHeight);|


|parameters | arguments |
|--|---|
|*such as: getArea(3,5);* | *such as: wWidth = 2; wHeight = 2; getArea(wWidth,wHeight);* |
|*when the function is declared, you can see the words width and height used (in parentheses on the first line). Inside the curly braces of the function*|*getArea () function is being called and the code specifies real numbers that will be used to perform the calculation (or variables that hold real numbers). These values that you pass into the code (the information it needs to calculate the size of this particular wall)* |

## getting a single value out of a function
- return inforimation
