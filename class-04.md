# Screen Sizes
#### **Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.**

# Screen Resolution
#### **Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.**


# Page Sizes
#### **Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide.**

### Fixed Width Layouts

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|--|--|
| Pixel values are accurate at controlling size and positioning of elements.| You can end up with big gaps around the edge of a page. |
| The designer has far greater control over the appearance.| If a user increases font sizes, text might not fit into the allotted spaces. |
| You can control the lengths of lines of text regardless of the size of the user's window.| If the user's screen is a much higher resolution than the designer's screen, the page can look smaller and text can be harder to read. |
| The size of an image will always remain the same | The design works best on devices that have a site or resolution similar to that of desktop or laptop computers. |


## Liquid Layouts

|Advantages| Disadvantages|
|--|--|
| The design is tolerant of users setting font sizes larger than the designer intended (because the page can stretch).| the design can look very different than you intended, with unexpected gaps around certain elements |
|Pages expand to fill the entire browser window so there are no spaces around the page on a large screen. | If the user has a wide window, lines of text can become very long |
| If the user has a small window, the page can contract to fit it without the user having to scroll to the side. | If the user has a very narrow window, words may be squashed |




## CSS Frameworks

|Advantages| Disadvantages|
|--|--|
| They save you from repeatedly writing code for the same tasks.|They often require that use class names in your HTML code that only control the presentation of the page | 
| They will have been tested across different browser
versions.| |



* Multiple Style Sheets
    * @import


# Function Methods & Objects

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
> group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).


### Declaring a function

# ARRAYS

> is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

* Create an array
    * give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array).
    * The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma.

* Values in array
    * accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

* Accessing & changing value in an array

* Expression 
> two types of expressions:
    1. Expression that just assign a value to a variable
    2. Expression that use two or more value to return a single value
