## HTML Structure:
- HTML pages are text documents.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.

## HTML5 Layout:
- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
_ You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.

##  Extra Markup:
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
