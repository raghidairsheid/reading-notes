# Choosing A Text Editor

#### first started out learning about web development, one of the things that I felt compelled to do was to download a text editor. I figured that I was going to be writing a good deal of code, and a good text editor should help me do that.

#### as I was scouring YouTube for how-to-code videos,the instructor always seemed to use a different text editor.

#### I don’t think that it truly matters as to which text editor you use. becouse, some text editing software comes with features that other text editing software does not.

#### I think the best text editor is truly the one that you enjoy using the most. That’s really the best one.

## What is a text editor?
#### is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

#### What features should you look for in a text editor? 
1. code completion.
2. syntax highlighting.
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue).
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. 

#### A great feature of any text editing software is ***code completion***.
> some code completion includes the closing of tags when you open them.
> Another nice feature is being able to write your ***HTML and CSS*** more efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called ***Emmet*** that can help. 

##### 1-  ***Emmet*** will speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.

#### 2- Another feature you should definitely look into is called ***syntax highlighting***. 
##### ***Syntax highlighting*** is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.

### Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer
- Every computer will come with its own text editor. 
  - On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Text Edit.” 
  - On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.”
  - On Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text editor already installed . These text editors will go by different names. One distro might have “Gedit,” and others might have other titles.


#### 3- Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded and installed to your computer from their respective websites.

## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs
- A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title — it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful.

- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
